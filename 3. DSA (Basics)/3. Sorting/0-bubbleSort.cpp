/*

* Stable Sort: This means if two elements are equal, their order in the sorted output will be the same as their order in the input.
ex: Input: [(4, 'A'), (3, 'B'), (4, 'C')]
    Output: [(3, 'B'), (4, 'A'), (4, 'C')]
ex: Merge Sort, Timsort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort.

* Unstable Sort: An unstable sort does not guarantee preserving the relative order of elements with equal values.
ex: Input: [(4, 'A'), (3, 'B'), (4, 'C')]
    Output: [(3, 'B'), (4, 'C'), (4, 'A')]
ex: Quick Sort (in most implementations), Heap Sort, Selection Sort.

* Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through an array, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. It starts at the beginning of the array and makes passes through it, with each pass moving the largest unsorted element to its correct position at the end. The process continues, reducing the range of comparisons each time, until no swaps are needed, indicating that the array is sorted. While easy to understand and implement, Bubble Sort has a time complexity of O(nÂ²) in the worst case, making it inefficient for large datasets.
