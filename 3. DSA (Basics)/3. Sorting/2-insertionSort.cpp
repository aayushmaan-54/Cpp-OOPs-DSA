* Insertion sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that builds a sorted array one element at a time. It works by taking each element from the unsorted portion and inserting it into the correct position within the sorted portion. Starting from the second element, it compares the current element to those in the sorted section and shifts larger elements to the right until it finds the appropriate spot. This process continues until all elements are sorted. Insertion sort has a time complexity of O(nÂ²) in the worst case but performs well on small or nearly sorted datasets.
